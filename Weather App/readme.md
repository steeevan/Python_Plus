The Weather App will be a console-based application that fetches and displays weather data for a specified location. The app will be structured using OOP principles, with classes to represent various components like locations, weather data, and user preferences. The app will fetch data from a weather API, process the data, and present it in a user-friendly format.

Modules to Use
requests: For making API requests to fetch weather data.
json: For parsing JSON data received from the API.
datetime: For handling date and time-related operations.
Project Structure
WeatherApp: The main class that coordinates the app's overall functionality.
Location: A class to represent a geographical location.
WeatherData: A class to represent the weather data for a specific location.
UserPreferences: A class to handle user-specific settings, like preferred units (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and saved locations.
APIClient: A class responsible for making API requests and returning data.
Class Design
Location Class

Attributes:
city: The name of the city.
country: The country code (optional).
latitude: Latitude coordinates (optional).
longitude: Longitude coordinates (optional).
Methods:
__init__(self, city, country=None): Initializes the location with city and country.
get_coordinates(self): Optionally fetch coordinates using an API if not provided.
WeatherData Class

Attributes:
temperature: Current temperature.
humidity: Humidity percentage.
pressure: Atmospheric pressure.
wind_speed: Wind speed.
description: Weather description (e.g., "clear sky").
datetime: Date and time of the weather data.
Methods:
__init__(self, temperature, humidity, pressure, wind_speed, description, datetime): Initializes the weather data.
__str__(self): Returns a formatted string representation of the weather data.
UserPreferences Class

Attributes:
units: Preferred units for temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit).
saved_locations: List of saved Location objects.
Methods:
__init__(self, units='metric'): Initializes user preferences with a default unit.
save_location(self, location): Adds a location to the saved locations.
remove_location(self, location): Removes a location from the saved locations.
get_saved_locations(self): Returns the list of saved locations.
APIClient Class

Attributes:
api_key: API key for the weather service.
base_url: Base URL for the API.
Methods:
__init__(self, api_key): Initializes the client with the API key.
fetch_weather_data(self, location): Fetches weather data for a given location and returns a WeatherData object.
parse_response(self, response): Parses the JSON response and extracts relevant weather data.
WeatherApp Class

Attributes:
api_client: An instance of APIClient.
user_preferences: An instance of UserPreferences.
Methods:
__init__(self, api_key): Initializes the app with the API key.
run(self): Main method to run the app, handling user interaction.
display_weather(self, location): Fetches and displays weather data for a location.
manage_preferences(self): Allows the user to change preferences and manage saved locations.
